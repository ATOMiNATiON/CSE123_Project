\subsection{Problem Definition}

\subsubsection{Need \& Goal Statements}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Need Statement - Traditional lock-and-key systems are inconvenient and insecure, as users may forget, lose, or have their keys stolen. Additionally, they obviously lack remote access, making it difficult for someone to enter the building if someone lost/forgot their tiny key.
    
    \item Goal Statement - Our smart lock will address these issues by enabling remote locking and unlocking, getting rid of the need for physical keys, and ensuring secure authentication for authorized users.
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{Design Objectives}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Remote access \& control: ESP32-C3 connection with Firebase
    
    \item Local authentication via keypad:
    \item Store \& validate PINs securely using Firebase cloud
    \item Multi-user support
    \item solenoid lock integration with ESP32

\end{itemize}
