\section{Functional Prototype}

% Should talk about the hardware, software, and cloud infrastructure we used compared to what we wanted.

\subsection{Hardware}

For our functional prototype, we used the ESP32-C3 microcontroller, solenoid lock, LEDs, transistors, and a keypad. The ESP32-C3 is the brain of the entire lock, being able to send and recieve signals from the server. Compared to our manufactured design, we will be building our own microcontroller so that it is customized to have the required functionality we need for our lock. As for the solenoid lock, we also plan to use a industry standard lock so that it can actually work on a door.
