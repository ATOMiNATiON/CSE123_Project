%% Research into existing designs and/or products that meet / partially meet the need %%

\subsection{Existing designs partially meeting the requirements}
There are several existing designs that partially meets the requirement of what we want. We will list out each of the product and explain about what it has and why it did not meet our expectation.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \href{https://www.amazon.com/August-Home-Connected-Electronic-%E2%80%8EAUG-SL05-M01-S01/dp/B082VXK9CK?th=1}{August Home}. This product has the ability to control the lock using a phone, can open the door for guest using phone. However the product does not have the ability to provide pin codes to guests say for a period of time.
    \item \href{https://a.co/d/3ruDPmO}{Schlage Encode Smart WiFi Deadbolt Lock for Front Door}. This product has a mobile application that allows keyless entry by entering pin codes directly on the door lock. It also provides a log of who unlocked the door during what time. It also can creates pin codes for guests and have scheduled codes for them. The only downside is that it only acts like a lock, it does not have a door handle. We would like to have our product to be the full set, a door handle along with a lock itself with the same functionality. We also do not know if their product have an emergency pin code that could work when the wifi is down.
    \item \href{https://a.co/d/g1BpVmg}{ULTRALOQ U-Bolt Pro WiFi Smart Lock}. This product has lots of features like fingerprint, keypad, and a physical key to unlock the door. It does provide custom pin code creation, allowing users to share their custom pin codes to guests. It also allows users to unlock their door by walking close to the lock itself. The cons is that it does not have a pin generation feature for the lock, it also does not have an emergency pin code that can help them unlock the lock when the wifi is down.
\end{enumerate}

%% Sustainability Statement %%
