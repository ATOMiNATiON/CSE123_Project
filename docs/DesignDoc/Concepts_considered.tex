\section{Concepts Considered}

% Need to talk about which concepts we took, and refer to the brainstorm idea.

Following extensive brainstorming and analysis, our team carefully evaluated a wide range of potential features and implementation strategies for our smart lock system. Ultimately, we selected the concept of using a solenoid-based locking mechanism controlled via a keypad and a smartphone app. This approach balanced feasibility, security, and user convenience. Our selection process included the use of the 6-3-5 method, which helped generate and refine a wide range of ideas across five categories: Hardware \& Mechanics, Smartphone Integration, Security Features, Software \& Control, and Advanced Features. We also brainstormed ideas of how the lock would potentially look like, for easy installation and fix up when an issue arises. All of our ideas were formed based on this appendix section: \ref{BrainstormingIdeas}.
