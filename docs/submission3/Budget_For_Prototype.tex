A table of costs for all the necessary parts in the above section \ref{DesignForManufacture}, "Design For Manufacture."

We also have the url link to our Components' Cost Table in Google Sheet \href{https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MM1I6pMeTvkLUvmaVntZBH55sUJj1Fe8FqNDRRbwthA/edit?usp=sharing}{here} \footnote{Make sure to use valid UCSC account to open the Google Sheet page}. The Google Sheet table provides more detailed information about where we can find the parts and the product description (that includes the datasheet). We will update our chart over time, if we do plan on getting things that was not yet listed here.
