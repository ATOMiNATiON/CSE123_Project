\section{Work Contribution as a Group}

\subsection*{6-3-5}
We all contributed to the brainstorming process using the 6-3-5 method, rotating between 4 rounds until each of us had added on to everyone else's initial thought. 

\subsection*{Brainstorming}
We all contributed to the overall brainstorming for our smart lock by writing on the same document any ideas we had for our respective smart locks. We generated any and all possibilities, including design features we'd seen previously. 

\subsection*{Morphological Charts}
We each drew up our own visions for the smart lock and key to get a better sense of how our ideas aligned and differed.

\subsection*{Mind Maps}
We created and organized a mind map for our smart lock. We visually structured our ideas to help each other see connections between different features so our approach could be more well-rounded.
