% During week 7, our team worked mainly on new design objectives and the need statement due to the unexpected leave of one of our teammates. Due to this unexpected leave of absence, our team was compelled to switch projects halfway through the quarter. We came up with a new project to work on for the next two quarters and had to redesign our project proposal. We also had to reassign roles and responsibilities to accommodate the new project. Below in this section, we will provide descriptions on what we all worked on during week seven.

% Below is our submission 1 before the switch to our new project idea. In submission 1, we designed the personas, need statement, goal statement, and Design Objectives in relation to the lithography machine idea we had for the first half of the quarter.
