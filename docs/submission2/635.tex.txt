\title{Auto Smart Lock Project 6-3-5 Brainstorm}

\begin{document}

\maketitle

\section{Hardware \& Mechanics}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Use a servo motor for deadbolt control.
    \item Hall effect sensor to detect if the door is open or closed.
    \item Implement linear actuator for silent locking.
    \item Maybe anti-backlash gears to reduce mechanical play.
    \item Consider designing a modular lock housing with 3D-printed parts.
    \item Have a backup battery to ensure operation during power outages.
\end{itemize}

\section{Smartphone Integration}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Develop a smartphone app for remote locking/unlocking.
    \item Push notifications for lock activity (e.g., ``Door locked at 3:45 PM'').
    \item Maybe have biometric authentication (e.g., Face ID or fingerprint).
    \item Use Bluetooth for proximity-based auto-unlock.
    \item Add NFC support for quick unlocking via phone tap.
    \item Include multi-user access control with time-based permissions.
\end{itemize}

\section{Security Features}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Implement AES-256 encryption for communication between the lock and phone.
    \item Maybe two-factor authentication for app access.
    \item Develop a tamper-detection alarm if the lock is forced.
    \item Lockdown mode for multiple failed attempts.
    \item Include a manual override mechanism in case of system failure.
    \item Utilize rolling codes for Bluetooth pairing to prevent hacking.
\end{itemize}

\section{Software \& Control}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Use an ESP32 microcontroller for Wi-Fi and Bluetooth control.
    \item Develop a closed-loop system to verify if the lock is engaged properly.
    \item Create a real-time event log accessible via the app.
    \item Add a scheduling feature for auto-locking at specific times.
    \item Implement a guest mode with temporary passcodes.
    \item Integration with voice assistants like Alexa or Google Assistant.
\end{itemize}

\section{Advanced Features}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Add geofencing to lock or unlock based on the user's location.
    \item Integrate with smart home platforms like Home Assistant.
    \item Use AI-based behavior analysis to suggest locking patterns.
    \item Add a camera with facial recognition for auto-unlock.
    \item Enable remote firmware updates via the app.
    \item Use solar charging for battery-powered locks.
\end{itemize}
