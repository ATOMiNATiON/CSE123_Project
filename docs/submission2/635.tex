\subsection{Hardware \& Mechanics}
\begin{itemize}
    \item use a servo motor for deadbolt control
    \item hall effect sensor to detect if the door is open or closed
    \item implement linear actuator for silent locking
    \item maybe anti-backlash gears to reduce mechanical play
    \item consider designing a modular lock housing with 3D-printed parts
    \item have a backup battery to ensure operation during power outages
\end{itemize}

\section{Smartphone Integration}
\begin{itemize}
    \item develop a smartphone app for remote locking/unlocking
    \item push notifications for lock activity (ex: ``Door locked at 3:45 PM'')
    \item have biometric authentication (Face ID or fingerprint)
    \item Use Bluetooth for proximity-based auto-unlock
    \item NFC support for quick unlocking via phone tap
    \item include multi-user access control with time-based permissions
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Security Features}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Implement AES-256 encryption for communication between the lock and phone
    \item maybe two-factor authentication for app access
    \item develop a tamper-detection alarm if the lock is forced
    \item lockdown mode for multiple failed attempts
    \item include a manual override mechanism in case of system failure
    \item utilize rolling codes for Bluetooth pairing to prevent hacking
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Software \& Control}
\begin{itemize}
    \item ESP32 microcontroller for Wi-Fi and Bluetooth control
    \item Develop a closed-loop system to verify if the lock is engaged properly
    \item make a real-time event log accessible via the app
    \item add a scheduling feature for auto-locking at specific times
    \item guest mode with temporary passcodes
    \item Integration with voice assistants like Alexa or Google Assistant
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Advanced Features}
\begin{itemize}
    \item GPS stuff
    \item add geofencing to lock or unlock based on the user's location
    \item integrate with smart home platforms like Home Assistant
    \item use AI-based behavior analysis to suggest locking patterns
    \item add a camera with facial recognition for auto-unlock
    \item enable remote firmware updates
    \item learn database SQL
    \item use solar charging for battery-powered locks
\end{itemize}
