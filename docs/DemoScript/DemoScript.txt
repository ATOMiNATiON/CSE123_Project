Before the Demo
- Prepare all text messages in advance to copy and paste during the demo.
- All components should be powered by separate batteries, not the laptop.
- The lock must be plugged into a 12V battery, not the laptop.
- The ESP32’s 5V input should also be powered by a battery.
- Set up should look realistic — ideally, the lock should appear connected to a wall power source.
- Be very clear when demonstrating re-authentication steps.

Introduction
“We built a smart lock solution that lets users lock and unlock their doors from anywhere, at any time—no physical key needed. Our lock supports secure authentication methods and provides flexible, time-based access control.”
