Introduction:


*SmartLock is bolted into a demo door (can be a part of an old separated door piece with a standard deadbolt setup that doesn’t necessarily need to be attached via hinge to any wall)*


Our smart lock solution will allow users to lock/unlock their doors from anytime and anywhere, eliminate the need for physical keys, and provide secure authentication methods for authorized users.


Demo Portion:


PARENT 1 - Nathanial
KID 1 - Neena
PARENT 2 - Jackson
KID 2 -


Scenario #1
Parents at Work
* Kid comes home from school
* Kid can’t unlock door
* Kid texts parent to unlock door
* Parent unlocks door from far away via mobile app lock/unlock as proof of concept of Parent unlocking from work with button functionalities


Scenario #2
Parents at work again
* Parent generates new PIN code to be used
* New pin gets reflected in PIN list in app
* Kid comes home from school
* Kid uses newly generated PIN to unlock door via keypad mechanism


Scenario #3
Lock Battery dies
* The lock shows no signs of having power
* Using a backup battery and a special unique keypad sequence to trigger extra power temporarily (only one time use)


Scenario #4
Setting time frame for a pin
* Set a new pin that has start and expiration time for a guest
* Showing that the new pin can only unlock during the creation of the pin, and in the time frame
* Show the pin does not work when it has past the expiration date


Conclusion:
To further improve this project in the future, a more cost and customizable alternative to Firebase could be used to store data more efficiently. Additionally, this new storage could be used alongside a more expensive fingerprint scanner for a form of MFA, where user fingerprints could be logged in a secure and non-invasive manner in a data storage with constant-security updates.


We will also be using our own custom board instead of the esp32c3 in our manufactured design for our product. Overall, we have achieved our minimum viable product, where we can unlock and lock our door using our phone or the keypad.
