SmartLock Demo Script
Adam Wu, Jackson Kennedy, Neena Nguyen, and Nathaniel Laurente
May 20, 2025

Before the Demo
- Prepare all text messages in advance to copy and paste during the demo.
- All components should be powered by separate batteries, not the laptop.
- The lock must be plugged into a 12V battery, not the laptop.
- The ESP32’s 5V input should also be powered by a battery.
- Set up should look realistic — ideally, the lock should appear connected to a wall power source.
- Be very clear when demonstrating re-authentication steps.

Introduction
Neena: “We built a smart lock solution that lets users lock and unlock their doors from anywhere, at any time—no physical key needed. Our lock supports secure authentication methods and provides flexible, time-based access control.”

Adam: “Here’s our schematic: we have our ESP32-C3 microcontroller and iOS app connected through Firestore Cloud. We handle Wi-Fi configuring using a one time set up access point, receive keypad inputs, and manage OTPs and emergency pins through the app. We also implemented features like logout, access logs, and a secure database for PIN handling.”

Nathaniel: “For the prototype, we’re using a 12V power supply, but our actual product design will include a 12V rechargeable battery.”

Scenario 1: Quick Remote Unlock
Demonstrates quick remote unlock via app.
1. Neena: “Nathaniel is coming home and forgot his keys. Adam plays the dad who’s at work.”
2. Nathaniel: “I forgot my keys, can you unlock the door for me?”
3. Adam: “I just got the text and will press Unlock on the app.”
4. Neena: “You can see the lock has retracted slightly. We’ll show it again for clarity—it’s a subtle visual change.”
5. Nathaniel texts back: “I’m in.”
6. Adam presses Lock.
7. Repeat the unlock/lock flow to show reliability.
8. Neena: “In the final version, we plan a notification system that alerts users if the door remains unlocked.”

Scenario 2: Guest One-Time PIN
Demonstrates one-time PIN functionality for visitors without app access.
