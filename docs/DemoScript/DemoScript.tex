\section*{Before the Demo}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1.5em]
    \item Prepare all text messages in advance to copy and paste during the demo.
    \item All components should be powered by separate batteries, \textbf{not} the laptop.
    \item The lock must be plugged into a \textbf{12V battery}, not the laptop.
    \item The ESP32’s \textbf{5V input} should also be powered by a battery.
    \item Set up should look realistic — ideally, the lock should appear connected to a wall power source.
    \item Be very clear when demonstrating re-authentication steps.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Introduction}
\textbf{Neena:} 
“We built a smart lock solution that lets users lock and unlock their doors from anywhere, at any time—no physical key needed. Our lock supports secure authentication methods and provides flexible, time-based access control.”\\
