Brainstorm 6-3-5 (Maskless Lithography)

-Linear actuator stage with double/split nut
-Linear glass encoders
-Use of a 3D printer controller for controlling the nema motors on the linear actuator stage.
-Making a closed loop system to correct for backlash and overshooting in code by measurements from the linear glass encoders
-looking into anti backlash nuts
-Figuring out if to buy DFU 1610 rods with aluminum extrusion to make our own linear actuator
-Use of a HEPA filter on top for positive air pressure provided by a shop vac if necessary
-Have a lens that ensures uniform exposure of light across area?
-creating custom parts to connect the stage with the rods to lower cost
-do small testing, to see machine accuracy

-app/software for patterns
-software element
-developing a GUI that accounts for the DMD patterns 
-Specialized brush for fine-tuned cleanup
-Custom controlled environment to limit debris
-Glasses with protective film lenses
-app to show a camera of the printing and tell if done also to upload what you want printed
-Switches for protection from UV light unless the box is closed
-Custom HPC for patterning 
-for app/software, an estimated timer of when lithography process is complete
-wrap around inside of box before process to ensure no dust/residue
-custom pcb design for connecting the pieces of the camera with stage
-creating software that will allow user to estimate how much materials will be used to design product

-Creating a moveable stage using stepper motors alongside rods with x-y axis
-Program movable glass mirrors to draw on glass, using a Pi as the controller
-Create a cardboard box as protection for our machine, integrating with air filter
-simple 3D printed enclosure
-customized air filter
-specialized DMD with more customization
- Customizing the firmware and software for the DMD to switch faster. We should be able to get 500 times the amount depending on speed of stage
-Needs to connect to a sufficient computer due to the high band width of the DMD.
-How fast can we make the stage with limiting backlash correction
-Optimize data to reduce amount of data sent to DMD

-finding open source resources online that’d help in the movement & precision of stage 
-implementing some sort of way to check for alignment to maximize precision
-how to prevent overheating
-safety mechanisms
-finding already 3D CAD designs for free to implement our product
-using an app to decide what to be drawn onto glass plate
-making a dark space for machine to work in for accuracy
-custom gloves to prevent contamination
-app with pattern snippets
-Make a custom PDK with very basic patterns
-Make everything open source to have contributions to benefit the whole community
-Check for alignment with a closed loop system with the encoders and the camera utilizing different light and metrology of materials.
-After finished product what revisions can be made to bring down costs and estimates for mass production
-When we have a final product, our product will already have been made with cheap material, how will we be able to reduce it further.

-UV light source protection
-What are the limitations for our resolution/ can we really get this to micron level?
-Will our product provide materials such as acid?
-making sure UV light & photoresist have matching wavelengths
-ensuring only UV light reaches photoresist, filtering out ambient lighting
-discuss/consider how many axis’ we need
-research other open source tools/programs to help with moving stage
-using camera with stepper motor to create more accurate stage movements
-using Pi with camera to detect movement accuracy
-custom program to determine slight inaccuracies and weak points
- We can at least achieve 2.5 micron level as other people have but with linear encoders we can hit micron level with proper coding
- We will have two axis on the stage and potentially a Z on the optics if needed
- Use a vacuum to hold down substrate
