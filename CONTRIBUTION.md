## ðŸ§  General Workflow

We've implemented a simple system that ensures only reviewed code gets merged into the main branch. One person must review each pull request (PR) before it's merged.

1. **Sync your fork**
   Go to your GitHub forked repository page and click the **Sync fork** button to get the latest changes from `main`.

2. **Update your local main branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull --ff-only

3. **Create a feature branch**
   ```bash
    git checkout -b "what_youre_working_on"

4. **Make your changes**
   - Write your code, edit files, and commit changes as needed.
   - When you try to push for the first time, Git might give an error with a suggested command. Just copy and use that.
