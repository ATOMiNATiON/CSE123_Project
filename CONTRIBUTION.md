## ðŸ§  General Workflow

We've implemented a simple system that ensures only reviewed code gets merged into the main branch. One person must review each pull request (PR) before it's merged.

1. **Sync your fork**
   Go to your GitHub forked repository page and click the **Sync fork** button to get the latest changes from `main`.
