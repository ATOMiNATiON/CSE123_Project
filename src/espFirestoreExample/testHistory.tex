\section*{Detailed Test Descriptions}

\subsection*{Test 1: Firebase Data Sync (April 7, 2025)}
Goal: Check if data from ESP32 updates properly in Firebase.
Method: Sent test data to Firebase and checked if it matched the received data.
Result: Data synced correctly without any issues. Also added a new test to check if the data was updated in the Firebase database.
Problems: None.

\subsection*{Test 2: Keypad Input Buffer (April 9, 2025)}
Goal: See if the keypad input buffer can handle multiple key presses quickly.
Method: Pressed multiple keys rapidly to check how many were recorded.
Result: Some key presses were missed.
Problems: Buffer size may be too small or not processing inputs fast enough.
